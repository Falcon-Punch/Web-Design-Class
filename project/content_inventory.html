     <h2>Content Inventory Questions:</h2>
     <dl>
        <dt>What did the client say that they want the web site to accomplish? Describe the goal of the  web site in one or two sentences. (Site Goals)</dt>
         <dd>The website should explain the client's product and services and aim to bring in new clients to the
         business. The website should provide customers with information and be a place where products can be 
         purchased online.</dd>
        <dt>Who is the intended audience? Who do you think will use the website? (Basic demographic information)</dt>
         <dd>The target market are people who are interested in seeing and learning more about Portland,
         OR.</dd>
        <dt>What opportunity, problem, or issue did you hear that the client wants to address?  (Deeper dive into the site goal)</dt>
         <dd>The client has not established how to market the site and is open to suggestions.</dd>
        <dt>What does the client want the site visitors to do? (call(s) to action)</dt>
         <dd>
            <ul>
                <li>Call us</li>
                <li>Fill out a contact form</li>
                <li>Search for information about our tours</li>
                <li>Booka a tour</li>
            </ul>
         </dd>
        <dt>List at least two related or similar sites found on the Web and why you think they are related. What did you like about the websites and what do you think you could improve on for the client's website? (competitive analysis)</dt>
         <dd><a href="http://www.portlandwalkingtours.com">Portland Walking Tours</a>: I like that it is very straight forward and to the point. I think it could improve graphically though. The site is basically just walls of text.</dd>
         <dd><a href="https://www.travelportland.com">Travel Portland</a>: This site has a lot more pictures than the previous one. Portland is a beautiful place and people want to see that on a site before making plans. Not too much to criticize with this site except maybe there is an overwhelming amount of content and it is easy to get lost or go on a tangent.</dd>
