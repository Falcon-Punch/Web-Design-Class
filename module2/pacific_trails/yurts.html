		<h2>The Yurts at Pacific Trails</h2>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>What is a yurt?</strong></dt>
					<dd>Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the ground. 
                    Each yurt <br>has canvas walls, a wooden floor, and a roof dome that 
                    can be opened.</dd>
				<dt><strong>How are the yurts furnished?</strong></dt>
					<dd>Each yurt is furnished with a queen-size bed with down quilt and 
                    gas-fired stove. <br>The luxury camping experience also includes electricity 
                    and a sink with hot and <br>cold running water. Shower and restroom facilities 
                    are located in the lodge.</dd>
				<dt><strong>What should I bring?</strong></dt>
					<dd>Bring a sense of adventure and some time to relax! Most guests also 
                    pack <br>comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for changing weather with 
                    layers <br>of clothing.</dd>
